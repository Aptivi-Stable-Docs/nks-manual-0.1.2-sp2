Installing Nitrocid KS on Windows is pretty easy, but we recommend installing the simulator using the Chocolatey package manager.

Extra kernel add-ons may require additional hardware on your computer to work. For example, the BassBoom addon requires that you have audio drivers installed on your computer.
{% endhint %}

To run Nitrocid KS in the absolute minimum requirements, your computer needs to have the following installed:

| System     | Framework                                                          | Terminal                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 7+ | [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) | [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) or Windows 10 cmd.exe |

However, we recommend that you have the below software installed on your computer to get the best out of the kernel:

| System      | Framework                                                          | Terminal           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Windows 10+ | [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) | Windows 10 cmd.exe |

Nitrocid KS will not put your PC at risk (except if you downloaded a copy from an unofficial software distributor, or from an unofficial source other than our official releases, our Chocolatey page found [here](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/KS), and our NuGet page found [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KS/)). Click on `More Info`, then click on `Run anyways`.
