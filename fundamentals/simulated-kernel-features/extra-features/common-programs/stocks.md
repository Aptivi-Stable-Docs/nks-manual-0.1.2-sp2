Nitrocid KS provides this feature as an addon.
{% endhint %}

Stocks is a 0.1.1 extra feature that allows you to see the most accurate simple stock price analysis of a company that is registered in the NASDAQ database. The interactive TUI that shows you the hourly stock information can be run by executing the "`stock`" command that allows you to check the current stock prices. You can optionally run this command with the company symbol.

{% hint style="info" %}
You might be prompted for your [AlphaVantage API key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). Get one for free here, but beware that it only allows 25 requests maximum per day.
{% endhint %}

This interactive TUI provides you with the following information:

* Hourly stock information
* Opening stock price
* High stock price
* Low stock price
* Closing stock price
* Stock volume
