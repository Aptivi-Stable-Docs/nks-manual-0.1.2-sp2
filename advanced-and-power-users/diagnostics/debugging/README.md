# Debugging

In-kernel debugging is a kernel facility that allows you to analyze the kernel components without using Visual Studio. This can be activated by passing `debug` to the kernel executable. This method has two ways.

## Locally

To get started debugging locally, press the below button

{% content-ref url="local-debugging.md" %}
[local-debugging.md](local-debugging.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Remotely

To get started debugging remotely, press the below button

{% content-ref url="remote-debugging.md" %}
[remote-debugging.md](remote-debugging.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
